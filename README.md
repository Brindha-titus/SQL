This project analyzes pathogenic genetic variants obtained from the ClinVar database maintained by the National Center for Biotechnology Information. The dataset was filtered to include only pathogenic variants mapped to the GRCh38 genome assembly. A total of 503,597 variants were imported into a PostgreSQL database for structured analysis. Variants were categorized by mutation type, gene symbol, and chromosomal location to examine mutation burden patterns. Results show that single nucleotide variants (SNVs) constitute the majority of pathogenic mutations, followed by deletions and insertion–deletion events. Gene-level aggregation revealed that certain genes accumulate disproportionately high numbers of pathogenic variants, consistent with known disease-associated loci. Chromosomal distribution analysis further demonstrated uneven mutation density across the genome. This study demonstrates how structured database systems can be used to explore clinically relevant genomic variation at scale.
